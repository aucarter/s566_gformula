We will be reviewing Keil, Alexander P., et al. "The parametric G-formula for time-to-event data: towards intuition with a worked example." Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.) 25.6 (2014): 889.

In addition, we will attempt to redo the analysis that the authors complete in SAS in this repo: https://github.com/alexpkeil1/Gformula-tutorial
